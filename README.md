# More Readable Schedule
Helps make the AUIS schedule more readable and efficient. 
Using the pdfplumber libirary, it reads american style course codes along with their dates and times to create a better looking table and schedule.

This programs story starts in 2020 when i started university and was given my university schedule as a pdf. My first thought at looking at the schedule was "wow this is ugly", so using my new found python skills i vowed to fix it.
